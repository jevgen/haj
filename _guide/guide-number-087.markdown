37 I will surely gather them from all the lands where I banish them in my furious anger and great wrath; I will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
Ezekiel 22:14-15 (NIV):
14 Will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day I deal with you? I the LORD have spoken, and I will do it.
