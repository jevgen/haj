        <h1>Too many Jews are denied their right to return to Israel</h1>
        <h2>We help Jews fight for their legal rights to make Aliya and return to the Holy Land of Israel</h2>
        ​
        <p>When an American Jew wishes to return home to Israel, a rabbinical letter is enough to get the immigration
            visa. However, in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), endless lists of documents and paperwork can make Aliya
            impossible. FSU Jews are treated unjustly, humiliated, and blocked from immigration by the same government
            that guarantees their right to it.</p>

        <p>Help a Jew - Help the Holy Land is a group of dedicated legal professionals who want to help those who have
            been denied their right to return to the Holy Land.</p>

        <p>We seek to help individual Jews fight for their God-given and legal rights to settle in Israel.</p>

        <p>The time of their homecoming is now, and you can be a part of the ingathering.</p>
