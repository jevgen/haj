                    Land of Israel</p>
                <p>When an American Jew wishes to return home to Israel, a rabbinical letter is enough to get the
                    immigration visa. However, in the Former Soviet Union (FSU), endless lists of documents and
                    paperwork can make repatriation impossible.</p>
                <p><em>Help a Jew. Help the Holy Land</em> is a group of dedicated legal professionals who want to help
                    those who have been denied their right to return to the Holy Land.</p>
