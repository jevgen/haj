            <p>Although every Jew has the right to repatriate to the Holy Land, too many are denied their opportunity by
                Israeli consular officials. The reasons for refusals vary, but the process is opaque and no written
                explanations are provided. For those with the legal and God-given right, this program provides grants to
                sponsor the Israeli Supreme Court appeals, specifically, it is aimed at would-be repatriates who cannot
                afford the legal fees themselves. With grants of up to $10,000 per case, Help a Jew. Help the Holy Land
                fights for every Jew's legal AND God-given right to return home to the holy land.</p>

            <p>For too many decades, Soviet Jews hid their identities for fear of persecution. Many of them took
                measures to erase the words, “Ethnicity: Jew” from their identity documents. As a result, those Jews and
                their descendants are not aware that they qualify for Israeli citizenship, nor that they could return to
                the Holy Land. This program spreads awareness and hope for Jews who never even tried to go through the
                repatriation process for lack of information. For those with the legal and God-given right, HELP A JEW
                promotes repatriation where official channels have ceased to function.</p>

            <p>There are Jews who know they could repatriate but never file an application because they’ve been scared
                off by the exhaustive list of documentation needed. Since the burden of proof is on the applicant, and
                requirements are rigorous, many people simply give up on returning to the Holy Land before they try. The
                archives in the Former Soviet Union contain official records of all of birth and death certificates.
                This program provides grants for applicants to engage professional archivists, building a searchable
                database for future repatriates. From Vladivostok to Minsk, Help a Jew. Help the Holy Land makes the
                proof less of a burden. </p>
